				<p>Hello!!!!</p>
				<p>This is Onur Ekiz. I am from Turkey. I moved to US in 2009. I came for my graduate studies and after found a job and still working. I live on Allen Park Way and Montrose. On the weekend you can see me guys at Bayou Park, biking running or just hanging out. At the weekends I like to go coffee shops and hang out with my friends. During the week I go and train jiujutsu. Its been 4-5 years since I started. I am loving it. I try to train as much as I can. I am in to soccer. That was what I did in Turkey. Go to games and cheer for my team! It  is a bit serious in Turkey. I am not a hooligan :p Well that is all I have. I am enjoying this bootcamp alot!!! </p>
